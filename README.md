# Pipefy UI Clone - (Rocketseat on YouTube)
This project was created to following
[a Rocketseat video that "clones" Pipefy interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awRtgpRsdTQ), for studying and React
practicing purposes.

## Third parties libraries used
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react);
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/);
- [React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about)
- [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer)

## Running locally
This is a React project, so to run it in your local machine you'll need to have Node and NPM or Yarn installed. With
this set, just run in your favorite shell the `npm install` or `yarn` command, to install the dependencies and the
`npm run start` or `yarn start`, to initialize the server, which will make the application available at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (the application will refresh when changes were done).

## Roadmap
After following the whole video, my goal is implementing some other features in this project like:

- [ ] Deploy on Heroku;
- [ ] Adapt the project to use TypeScript;
- [ ] Open card details in a modal;
- [ ] Cards CRUD;
- [ ] Lists CRUD;
- [ ] Lists Drag and Drop;
- [ ] State Management;
- [ ] Explore other drag and drop options that are available in React DnD;
- [ ] Creating a Back-End to data persistence (probably using SQLite3 and Node with GraphQL);
- [ ] Connecting a GraphQL Client;
- [ ] Esquema de criação e login de usuários
- [ ] Criar um avatar default, caso o usuário logado não tenha imagem cadastrada
