# Pipefy UI Clone - (Rocketseat on YouTube)
This project was created to following
[a Rocketseat video that "clones" Pipefy interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awRtgpRsdTQ), for studying and React
practicing purposes.

## Third parties libraries used
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react);
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/);
- [React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about)
- [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer)

## Running locally
This is a React project, so to run it in your local machine you'll need to have Node and NPM or Yarn installed. With
this set, open your favorite shell and run the commands below:
1. `npm install` or `yarn`, to install the dependencies;
2. `npm run start` or `yarn start`, to initialize the server.

After that the application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and it will
refresh when changes were done in the code.

## Roadmap
After following the whole video, my goal is implementing some other features in this project like:

- [ ] Deploy on Heroku;
- [ ] Adapt the project to use TypeScript;
- [ ] Open card details in a modal;
- [ ] Cards CRUD;
- [ ] Lists CRUD;
- [ ] Lists Drag and Drop;
- [ ] State Management;
- [ ] Explore other drag and drop options that are available in React DnD;
- [ ] Creating a Back-End to data persistence (probably using SQLite3 and Node with GraphQL);
- [ ] Connecting a GraphQL Client;
- [ ] Esquema de criação e login de usuários
- [ ] Criar um avatar default, caso o usuário logado não tenha imagem cadastrada
